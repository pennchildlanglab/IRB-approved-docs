# Acquisition of variation in child language learners
Informed consent to participate in research study

**Primary Investigator**: Kathryn Schuler, kschuler@sas.upenn.edu

You are invited to take part in a research study conducted by Kathryn Schuler in the Linguistics Department at the University of Pennsylvania. This consent form explains what we are studying and what you will be invited to do if you choose to consent. Please read and sign this form to confirm that you have been informed about the study and that you want to take part.

What we are studying:  We are studying how people learn languages and the ways in which their ability to do so changes with age. 

What you will do: You will be invited to play a 20 to 30-minute computer game in which you will be taught aspects of a made-up language that we have developed in our lab.  During the game, you will be asked to respond (by pressing a button or speaking) to simple questions about the language you are learning. You will play the game in one session, though we may invite you to play in up to 3 additional sessions. 

Risks: The risks associated with this study are minimal, though you may experience slight discomfort due to boredom. There is also a minimal risk of unauthorized parties accessing responses (e.g. computer hackers), because your responses are entered and stored on an https server.  This risk is minimized by Prolificâ€™s secure server and user anonymization.

Benefits: Participating in this study will not benefit you directly.  You may enjoy contributing to the study of language and cognitive science.

Ending your participation: You can choose whether or not to participate in this study. If you decide to participate now but change your mind later, you may withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences.  You can stop participating at any time by closing your browser window.

Your rights: Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You may decline to participate or withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences.

Confidentiality: In order to keep your information safe, Prolific protects your personal information by assigning you an anonymous ID number and operating over a secure server. No identifiable information is revealed to our research team aside from this anonymous ID, nor do we solicit this information from you.

Data use: We may share your anonymized data with approved members of our research team, but your ID number will never be associated with any data that is shared.  The overall results of this study may be published in scientific journals or discussed at academic conferences, but will never include your ID or any other personally identifying information.

Compensation: You will be paid according to the amount of time required to complete the study, in alignment with a rate of $12 per hour.
